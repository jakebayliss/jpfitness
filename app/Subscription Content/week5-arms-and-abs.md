[WARM UP]

- Start with your arms fully relaxed, then curl up to half way up your arm or a 90 degree arm-forearm angle - rep 7 times like this, then 7 in the upper half and 7 complete curls

- Form is incredibly important to ensure your bi's are constantly engaged

- Always go to failure on close grip part

- Short rest between sets, get that blood flowing

- Depending on your bicep/tricep strength I would recommend a weight ~1/3 your bodyweight

- Lock your elbows when doing your overheads, it's essential for tricep engagement

- I rep 25kg, 21 reps bicep curls, 8-10 reps overhead extensions and failure for close grip bench

- Start with arms vertical, slowly curl upwards until you're at the natural 'top' of the rep as in video, slow release back down

- Also great to pair with a chest exercise if you want a sneaky arm pump on chest day

- Slow and controlled is key

- Do less weight than you would normally curl, these are targeted and harder

- Lock your elbows into the bench to establish a good pivot point for your arm

- Roll shoulders back to isolate those biceps

- Keep your upper arm as vertical as you can

- I use 10-12kg dumbbells for 12 reps

- Killer superset, lock those fkn elbows!!

- Really pull OUTWARDS at the bottom of every rep to engage those tri's

- Don't let your arms come all the way up, stop roughly where I stop in the video

- These are both unreal to dropset if you're feeling frisky!

- Weight for these is highly dependant on what kind of cable machine you use. Some of them I'm ~20kg for 8 reps, others I do around 40kg

- Lock elbows as per!!

- Try minimise upper-body rocking, I know it's hard but try!

- Arms are spaced extremely close to one another, inside elbow-width apart with pinky fingers almost touching

- Close grip curls are amazing for increasing the size of the peak of your bicep - which is what we're chasing baby!

- As above, they're amazing to dropset!

<summary><b>Preacher Curls SS Long Negatives</b></summary

- Slooooow negatives

- Good tip is to set up the chair height perfectly for you. The height that feels best for me is demonstrated in the video and it's fairly low as I like my whole upper body locked in place

- If you don't have a gym partner then do 8 exactly as I do in the video - 8 reps of normal preacher curls, 4-8 reps of slow, strong negatives

- Weight is not so important here - more important is form and how slowly you can lower the bar each time

- If you can get a friend/gym partner to resist (push down) while you try hold the negatives as long as possible this will have you both looking and feeling like superman/superwoman

- I currently do 12.5kg on either side of the bar for 8 reps then 4-6 ultra long negatives to finish each set

<summary><b>Dips SS Hammers</b></summary

- Definitely start these on an assisted machine.

- Start with your elbows locked and arms straight, then slowly lower yourself to 90 degrees (the forearm/upper arm angle I reach in the vid) then power back up to vertical

- Dips are amazing for both chest and triceps so you could include in your chest day too

- Don't go too far down or you'll hurt your shoulder, 90 degree bend like in the video is good

- If you can't dip your bodyweight then use the assisted machine that most gyms provide

- I do 8-12 reps of body weight dips

- Lock your elbows into your obliques for best form

- Slow reps down, maximise control

- For maximum burn on any curls don't let your arms go completely vertical - this keeps your bicep engaged for the duration of your set

- Minimise body-rocking while curling for complete bicep engagement

- Start light and work your way up as form/strength improves

- Currently on 16kg for 8 reps each arm

<summary><b>Notes for Abs</b></summary>

- Medicine ball leg taps, medicine ball sit-ups and oblique extensions are to be done one after the other - do 1 set of leg taps, 1 set of med-ball situps, 1 set of extensions then rest - repeat 4 times then move to the next section

- Incline med-ball situps are done individually for 4 sets, as are leg extensions.

- Today is the only day that is centred around training abs in the gym. I highly recommend trying this at either end of your workout as it makes you feel so fkn accomplished and leaving the gym like an absolute beast.

<summary><b>Medicine Ball Legs Taps</b></summary>

- Position yourself so the medicine ball is approximately under your calves

- Extend legs all the way out, don't let your feet touch the floor

- Sync your body - as your legs extend lean backwards to really engage your abs 

- Quick reps, high intensity

- Aim for 10 per side, so 20 total taps

- Controlled movements - don't go too heavy as you'll start using every part of your body other than your abs to try get it completed 

- Extend those arms as you come down, don't let the ball touch the floor

- Thrust upwards with your abs, hold at the top slightly and repeat

- I like to do these with an 8kg medicine ball, 12 reps minimum

- The biggest take home message is to keep your back as I keep mine in the video

- Don't lean forward or backwards, lean perfectly straight (in the lateral direction) as I do in the second half of the video

- Pull with your obiques, having one hand on the opposite side of your body to the weight - I find - really helps me mentally picture lifting using purely my obliques

- Hold at the top, slowly back down

- I do 16 reps minimum (each side) using a 20kg plate

- The biggest tip is the point of rotation: Rotate once your upper body is PARALLEL with the bench angle - DON'T COME ALL THE WAY UP

- Rotate 90 degrees right then 90 degrees left - pick a point either side of you and look at that point every time you rotate that direction to ensure complete rotation

- Extend your arms all the way back behind your head while engaging your core the entire time

- As with all other exercises practice with no weight until you get the movement correct then upgrade to weight

- I use the 8kg medicine ball and aim for 10 reps total

- By far my favourite Ab exercise! 

- As mentioned in the video, your bum position determines exercise difficulty

- If your bum is entirely off the end of the bench then the exercise is most difficult as your point of rotation is further away from your feet 

- If your bum is half way off (tail bone approx. at the edge of bench) this is medium difficulty

- If your bum is entirely on the bench this is the easiest difficulty

- Legs straight on the downward leg, almost touch the floor with your heels but don't bounce/push off

- Straight legs as you pull back up then once you reach your hip area bend your knees, pull in with your upper abs and thrust your legs your legs vertically away from you

- Hold at the top, elevating your bum off the bench as in the video 

- Go for 8 reps, however please understand these are hard (especially for beginners) so get as many reps in as you can! -
