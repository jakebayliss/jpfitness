- Close grip doesn't necessarily mean pinky fingers touching like it does for other exercises, go shoulder width apart

- I am well aware these are also targeting your upper-back and I still chose to do them because there's no such thing as doing too many pull-ups!

- Use an assisted machine if you can't do them on their own - this is totally normal they're an extremely hard exercise!

- Go for failure every set, it doesnâ€™t matter if this is 3, 6 or 20 reps - burn yourself out we're at the end of an amazing arms day here

- Weight - N/A, each set til FAILURE BABY

- [WARM UP]
  
- Lock elbows for the duration of your set

- Don't let your hands come too far above elbow height to ensure triceps are constantly engaged

- Hold bar at the edge and push outwards at the bottom while you SQUEEZE

- Ensure you're squeezing every rep - burn those triceps baby

- Lock elbows as per!!

 -Try minimise upper-body rocking, I know it's hard but try!

 -Arms are spaced extremely close to one another, inside elbow-width apart with pinky fingers almost touching

- Close grip curls are amazing for increasing the size of the peak of your bicep - which is what we're chasing baby!

- As above, they're amazing to drop-set!

- Amazing exercise for building that outer head and increasing arm thickness

- Tip is to stand right in the centre of the cable and extend outwards at an angle

- This means you'll already naturally be finishing each rep with your arm angled outwards, further targeting your lateral (outer) head

 -As with all tricep exercises SQUEEZE at the bottom

- Try perform these isolated curls on a bench right near your cable extensions

- Lock your elbow firmly into your leg and curl normally

- Start low weight until you get the form correct then work your way up

- These are a targeted exercise so don't over-do yourself weight wise

- Squeeze at the top and slow release back down

- I typically rep 8-10kg and do 4 sets of the Superset

- Definitely start these on an assisted machine.

- Start with your elbows locked and arms straight, then slowly lower yourself to 90 degrees (the forearm/upper arm angle I reach in the vid) then power back up to vertical

- Dips are amazing for both chest and triceps so you could include in your chest day too

- Don't go too far down or you'll hurt your shoulder, 90 degree bend like in the video is good

- If you can't dip your bodyweight then use the assisted machine that most gyms provide

- I do 8-12 reps of body weight dips

- Lock your elbows into your obliques for best form

- Slow reps down, maximise control

- For maximum burn on any curls don't let your arms go completely vertical - this keeps your bicep engaged for the duration of your set

- Minimise body-rocking while curling for complete bicep engagement

- Start light and work your way up as form/strength improves

- Currently on 16kg for 8 reps each arm

- Start with your arms fully relaxed, then curl up to half way up your arm or a 90 degree arm-forearm angle - rep 7 times like this, then 7 in the upper half and 7 complete curls

- Form is incredibly important to ensure your bi's are constantly engaged

- Always go to failure on close grip part

- Short rest between sets, get that blood flowing

- Depending on your bicep/tricep strength I would recommend a weight ~1/3 your bodyweight

- Lock your elbows when doing your overheads, it's essential for tricep engagement

- I rep 25kg, 21 reps bicep curls, 8-10 reps overhead extensions and failure for close grip bench
