Workout 2:

Today's ab workout is designed to be able to be done anywhere, anytime. This is an adaption of the workout I would do first thing in the morning when I was grinding every single day for abs. If you have the same drive then I highly recommend doing this workout nearly every day when you wake up. It's such an amazing start to the day and you can really see results quickly.

As with Day 1, it's a continuous circuit - you do the first exercise, then the next, then the next all the way up until the last and that counts as 1 set. Repeat 4 times and that's your abs routine conquered for the day!

<summary><b>Bicycle Kicks</b></summary>

- Start lying flat on the ground, raise both legs off the ground and engage your core so your head is also off the ground, supported by your hands behind your head

- Bring one knee in to your chest and simultaneously bring your opposite elbow in to touch that knee (as in the video)

- Once you have the movement locked in speed it up - I like to do my bicycles at a rapid pace for a great burn 

- As explained in the video a great tip is to pick an object at 90 degrees either side of you so youâ€™re looking at it, and thus rotating the correct amount, every rep

- Aiming for a minimum of 20 reps, 10 elbow taps on each side

<summary><b>Oblique Planks</b></summary>

- Start in a plank position - basically a push up but on your elbows 

- Lock your feet together and in place

- Rotate your hips to one side of your body and let that hip touch the floor

- Rotate back the other way and touch your other hip

- Repeat 20 times, 10 hip-taps on each side

- Hold your back strong throughout and lean/rotate with your oblique muscles

<summary><b>Side-plank Thrusts</b></summary>

- Begin lying on your side, supporting your bodyweight with your elbow

- Ensure your back is straight and your body forms a straight line from your head to the toes

- Engage your core before you start the movement - then thrust upward by lifting your hips

- Once at the top, your body should form a straight line down to your toes

- Avoid over-arching your back by keeping your core engaged throughout 

- I aim for 16 reps on each side, 32 total for the set

<summary><b>Alternating Toe-Taps</b></summary>

- These are a killer finisher to our rotation

- Lie flat with your arms and legs extended all the way

- Raise one leg vertical and crunch up to meet it as I do in the video, engaging your core the entire time

- Tap that leg with your opposite arm and then lower back down 

- Repeat with the opposite leg/arm 

- I aim for 10 taps each arm, 20 taps total
