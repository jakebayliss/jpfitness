# Welcome - Abs

WELCOMEEEEEEE to the best Abs routine that you could have possibly found (jks it might not be but it's what works for me and therefore what should work for you guys too!) . The main thing I need to warn all you guys of is that this is not professional fitness advice, I don't have any personal training/fitness instructor courses under my belt - this is simply my best advice based entirely off what has worked for me for multiple years now. 

This Ab routine is designed to make you reach your abdominal goals as quickly as possible. It's vicious and you'll leave each session with your core on fire but it's what's needed to hit those goals baby! My ab exercises are split up into 3 days, which I interchange and rotate as I see fit. However, just because they're labelled 1, 2 and 3 doesn't mean you have to do them in that order or you're restricted to training them 3 times a week max. If you're extra motivated then feel free to do as you see please. However, please remember how important rest is for muscle growth! Also, if you're doing the ab routine with the workout plan you'll be hitting abs on various different cardio days - so no need to go over the top.

I've provided a large number of ab exercises spread over the course of 3 main workouts. If, once you've completed the workouts a few times, you feel like mixing and matching then please go for it! Tailor the individual exercises I've given you to your specific ab goals. For example, if you're chasing that V-line then construct an oblique-oriented day etc.

My personal preference is to do each 'ab day' at the end of a main bodypart workout and to do it as many days of the week as I can manage (nearly always twice, sometimes if I'm feeling extra motivated then 3 times a week but that's hard work!). As you can see, the workouts are segmented into a day where being at the gym is required and 2 days where it's not. I tend to do most of my ab days at the gym as I love tagging them on the end of a workout. When the weather is good and I'm feeling extra motivated I'll save one of the 'at home' (days 2 or 3) ab days for the weekend and go do it in a local park or in the back garden! 

My personal goal with abs is to stay as lean as possible while ensuring I have a 6 pack and it pops as best it can. If I don't train abs for a week or so I can definitely notice a difference so I try and stay as consistent as possible. At the peak of my ab-training obsession I was working out every morning for 15 minutes on my bedroom floor right next to my bed. It was the first thing I did in the morning (after drinking a glass of water) and would wake me up for the day. Try this with day 2 if you dare!

Motivation is the key to success and there are plenty of methods for maintaining yours:

- Progress photos: Advised to be taken at the start of your journey (this program) to be looked back on to see just how far you've come

- Stick to this program as consistently as you can. The key to developing your abs is consistency so keep at it! 

- Track your progress - this, similarly to Progress Pics, is a great way to see how far you've come and how far you've still got to go. Are you increasing the amount of reps you're doing each time you re-do one of the days? Are you less tired at the end of a session and could easily squeeze in a 5th circuit? Go for it!

- The framework I have developed for getting and maintaining a strong core is based around burning out abs as much as I can every time I train them - Now this may be frowned upon by professional trainers however it's what works for me so I've included it in this program!

- Workout with noise cancelling headphones or a speaker if you're at home - it makes the world of difference
