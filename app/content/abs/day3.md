- Extend one leg straight out behind you, point your toes then bring your leg all the way up so your knee almost touches your elbow

- Try and maintain a straight back and don't twist your body, keeping your core engaged and pulling your leg up with your obliques

- 12 reps on one side then swap arms and do another 12 reps on the other side

- Keep your core engaged the entire time and pull with your oblique muscles

- 12 reps on each side, swap sides and do 12 on the other!

- I like to do crunches with feet shoulder width apart and hands crossed on my chest

- You can do them with hands behind your head but cheat & pull yourself up like this! 

- Make sure you're pulling up with your abs!! 

- You guys know bicycle form by now, pick a point on either side of you at 90 degrees and make sure you look at it each rep to ensure complete torso rotation!

- 20 reps of crunches, 20 bicycles

- These are usually done lying flat on the floor, and if you'd like to mainly hit lower abs then feel free to do lying scissor kicks 

- I've opted to do them at a slight incline so it engages my whole core while still hitting lower abs

- Point your feet and try keep your legs as straight as possible, raising them as high as you can each rep and don't let your feet hit the floor on the way down

- 20 reps total

- Toe-tap form is determined by how close/far apart your feet are - the closer they are together the harder the exercise will be, as you core will have to rotate further to touch each foot

- Perform them at a slight incline so your abs are engaged the whole time 

- You guys are also mountain climbers experts now so smash these out as you've been doing during Day 2! 

- 20 toe-taps, 20 climbers!
