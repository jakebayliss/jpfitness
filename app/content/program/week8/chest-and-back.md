- Heavily influenced incline chest routine as I have always felt my lower chest grows faster than my upper - thus I like to focus on my upper and really go for that full look

- Careful with your form picking up heavy dumbbells, I know better than most about annoying back pain caused from the gym

- Bench angle determines where on your chest is activated - the higher up you go (to a certain point then it becomes majoritively shoulders) the more upper chest it works

- If you're happy with where your upper chest is and you'd much rather work your entire chest then scroll down to the 'bench' section and implement dumbbell flat bench here

- Form is crucial here, especially as you increase weight - careful not to go below your shoulder line on the downward part of movement

- I'm currently on 40kg dumbbells for incline press, 6 reps, working my way up to 8 reps gradually!

- Form form form - don't go too heavy until you've got your form 100% down

- Do not injure your back doing these, be extremely careful and if you have any doubts ask a gym employee for assistance

- For similar reasons to not doing deadlifts my T-bar row weight is not that high - I'm mainly concerned about form so will max out at around two plates

- Currently on 2 20kg plates and one 5 kg plate going for 12 reps per set

- Position your arms as close as you can to mine in the video - don't flair your elbows out and don't have them touching your obliques either - go in the middle

- Keep dumbbells angled at 45 degrees as I have, not straight in line with your shoulders as most people do

- Bring dumbbells back down in-line with your chest, pause briefly then EXPLODE and push upwards til your elbows are locked once again

- Once you've done 8 reps lock the dumbbells together (as demonstrated in the video) and go to failure with this burner set

- I'm currently on roughly 25kg for this superset - any heavier and the burner set becomes nearly impossible for me!

- Essential upper back exercise to give yourself that swole look

- Strict form as always, make sure to pull all the way back, PAUSE, then slowly release back to an extended arm position

- Amazing point to include your dropset for today - do 3 working sets then dropset the last (4th) set baby!!

- I'm currently on roughly 50kg for 10 reps!

- x3 sets of pull ups (preferably non-assisted) but if you require assistance then that's perfectly fine too!

- If you can only do a handful of reps that's totally fine too, keep at it and gradually build yourself up to 8-12 reps

- Here I'm looking to pull up with the lats and back - not with your arms, get your head as high as possible and hold at the top

- As many bodyweight reps as you can for 3 sets!

- Go FKN HEAVYYYYYYY!!! I want you doing MAX 6 reps - so find a weight where you can barely do 5 reps then push for that 6th - use a spot if you need! 
  
- Slow and controlled, come down to just above your chest every rep, don't bounce the bar off it but make sure you get full range of motion

- If you're unsure or not confident in yourself as you're just starting out then get someone friendly in the gym to come assist/spot you!

- Typically rep 70kg after a long chest session for 3-4 sets but today I'm doing 80kg!

- You MUST do the 15 push-ups in between sets today. So I want every set of cables superset with push ups for x4 total sets

- Position the cables at or slightly above head height

- Position yourself at the centre of the machine, then step forward into the space in front and lock your legs in place

- I'm then looking to find the perfect arm angle (the same angle you used on incline DB flys up above) to maximise chest gains while minimising shoulder injuries

- Lock your arms in place and pull with your chest, squeezing as hard as you can as your hands touch

- I do 12.5kg in downward flys for 10 reps

</figure>

- As above, position yourself in the centre of the machine but this time don't step forward

- Legs shoulder width apart, arms similar angle to above

- Stick your chest out and pull up with your chest, activating it the whole way through

- Squeeze at the top, 12 reps minimum and now is when I would superset with pushups if you have it in you!

- I do 10.5kg for 8 reps in this direction
