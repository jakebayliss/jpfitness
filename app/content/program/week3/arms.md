<summary><b>Preacher Curls SS Long Negatives</b></summary

- Slooooow negatives

- Good tip is to set up the chair height perfectly for you. The height that feels best for me is demonstrated in the video and it's fairly low as I like my whole upper body locked in place

- If you don't have a gym partner then do 8 exactly as I do in the video - 8 reps of normal preacher curls, 4-8 reps of slow, strong negatives

- Weight is not so important here - more important is form and how slowly you can lower the bar each time

- If you can get a friend/gym partner to resist (push down) while you try hold the negatives as long as possible this will have you both looking and feeling like superman/superwoman

- I currently do 12.5kg on either side of the bar for 8 reps then 4-6 ultra long negatives to finish each set

<summary><b>Dips SS Hammer Curls</b></summary

- Definitely start these on an assisted machine.

- Start with your elbows locked and arms straight, then slowly lower yourself to 90 degrees (the forearm/upper arm angle I reach in the vid) then power back up to vertical

- Dips are amazing for both chest and triceps so you could include in your chest day too

- Don't go too far down or you'll hurt your shoulder, 90 degree bend like in the video is good

- If you can't dip your bodyweight then use the assisted machine that most gyms provide

- I do 8-12 reps of body weight dips

- Lock your elbows into your obliques for best form

- Slow reps down, maximise control

- For maximum burn on any curls don't let your arms go completely vertical - this keeps your bicep engaged for the duration of your set

- Minimise body-rocking while curling for complete bicep engagement

- Start light and work your way up as form/strength improves

- Currently on 16kg for 8 reps each arm

- Start with arms vertical, slowly curl upwards until you're at the natural 'top' of the rep as in video, slow release back down

- Also great to pair with a chest exercise if you want a sneaky arm pump on chest day

- Slow and controlled is key

- Do less weight than you would normally curl, these are targeted and harder

- Lock your elbows into the bench to establish a good pivot point for your arm

- Roll shoulders back to isolate those biceps

- Keep your upper arm as vertical as you can

- I use 10-12kg dumbbells for 12 reps

- Start with your arms fully relaxed, then curl up to half way up your arm or a 90 degree arm-forearm angle - rep 7 times like this, then 7 in the upper half and 7 complete curls

- Form is incredibly important to ensure your bi's are constantly engaged

- Always go to failure on close grip part

- Short rest between sets, get that blood flowing

- Depending on your bicep/tricep strength I would recommend a weight ~1/3 your bodyweight

- Lock your elbows when doing your overheads, it's essential for tricep engagement

- I rep 25kg, 21 reps bicep curls, 8-10 reps overhead extensions and failure for close grip bench

- Killer superset, lock those fkn elbows!!

- Really pull OUTWARDS at the bottom of every rep to engage those tri's

- Don't let your arms come all the way up, stop roughly where I stop in the video

- These are both unreal to dropset if you're feeling frisky!

- Weight for these is highly dependant on what kind of cable machine you use. Some of them I'm ~20kg for 8 reps, others I do around 40kg

- Lock elbows as per!!

- Try minimise upper-body rocking, I know it's hard but try!

- Arms are spaced extremely close to one another, inside elbow-width apart with pinky fingers almost touching

- Close grip curls are amazing for increasing the size of the peak of your bicep - which is what we're chasing baby!

- As above, they're amazing to dropset!

- I'm on 42kg for 10-12 reps

- Start low weight and work on your form

- Bring the weight all the way down stopping behind your head (be very careful NOT to overextend)

- Alternate arms with no breaks inbetween

- I'm do 10kg for overhead tricep extensions but this is limited by my minor left elbow injury, I'm sure you guys can do more!
