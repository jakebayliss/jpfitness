- Warm-up set with body weight then straight into it

- Don't over-stride - keep stride length reasonable so you're not over extending, losing balance

- Shoulders back, vertical torso - core engaged, knee directly over ankle with majority of your weight in your front foot

- Superset with bodyweight squats (mainly so I can still incorporate squats and reap some of their benefits)

- I like to do ~14kg each arm, 10 reps each leg

- Feet shoulder width apart, bend your hips and knees simultaneously

- Lean back into the squat - hinging at the hips, keep your back neutral and core engaged

- I do bodyweight sets here as my lower back is injured!

- Back rest position is once again key - I like to have it configured so, when resting on the press, my legs are slightly bent (as in the video)

- This enables me to comfortably push off the safety holders and gives a nice smooth full range of motion during the set

- Don't go too heavy if it's your first time doing leg press - start off with no weight to get used to the machine and the safety mechanism then start to stack up weight as you see fit!

- If you're properly positioned (as above) then once you lock the machine back in its starting position you can begin calf raises without any adjustments

- This is great because you don't need to disengage the safety to do calf raises now!

- I typically leg press x3 20kg plates either side and calf raise the same!

- FORM FORM FORM

- I can't stress this enough for lateral lunges - form is so important

- Start legs together with the foot you're going to be stepping with SLIGHTLY in front of your back foot

- Step out so your front foot is slightly in front of your back foot, the previous step helps ensure this happens every rep

- Now, lean back with your hips keeping your core upright and solid throughout

- Imagine there's a bench behind you that you're trying to sit on

- Don't use any weight until you're 100% confident with your form!

- I do no weight because of my lower back but once you've got your form locked I recommend starting by holding a 5kg plate and working your way up!

- Potentially the most important exercise to get your form correct

- You can see in the video how much I'm looking at the camera to ensure my form is correct

- Firstly, stand shoulder width apart and bend your knees

- Sit backwards with your hips and keep your back in a neutral position

- Don't allow your back to overextend (arch forwards) on the way down

- Stop around sock/ankle height so you don't go too far and force your back to over extend

- Pull upwards using your hamstrings and back

- I rep around the 10kg mark for these with great caution to not do my back in again!

- Similarly to the above leg extensions you want to position the machine so your knees are pivoting nicely off the bench

- Machine required for these as it's much faster - x2 normal sets then x1 drop set: Start at your working weight for 6 reps, drop 2 pegs for 8 reps, 2 more pegs for 10 reps and finally 2 more pegs til failure

- I'm currently doing 65kg to start with then dropping in increments of 8kg each time I drop set

<summary><b>Notes for Abs</b></summary>

- Medicine ball taps, medicine ball sit-ups and oblique extensions are to be done one after the other - do 1 set of leg taps, 1 set of med-ball situps, 1 set of extensions then rest - repeat 4 times then move to the next section

- Incline med-ball situps are done individually for 4 sets, as are leg extensions.

- Today is the only day that is centred around training abs in the gym. I highly recommend trying this at either end of your workout as it makes you feel so fkn accomplished and leaving the gym like an absolute beast.

<summary><b>Medicine Ball Legs Taps</b></summary>

- Position yourself so the medicine ball is approximately under your calves

- Extend legs all the way out, don't let your feet touch the floor

- Sync your body - as your legs extend lean backwards to really engage your abs 

- Quick reps, high intensity

- Aim for 10 per side, so 20 total taps

- Controlled movements - don't go too heavy as you'll start using every part of your body other than your abs to try get it completed 

- Extend those arms as you come down, don't let the ball touch the floor

- Thrust upwards with your abs, hold at the top slightly and repeat

- I like to do these with an 8kg medicine ball, 12 reps minimum

<summary><b>Oblique Extensions</b></summary>

- The biggest take home message is to keep your back as I keep mine in the video

- Don't lean forward or backwards, lean perfectly straight (in the lateral direction) as I do in the second half of the video

- Pull with your obiques, having one hand on the opposite side of your body to the weight - I find - really helps me mentally picture lifting using purely my obliques

- Hold at the top, slowly back down

- I do 16 reps minimum (each side) using a 20kg plate

- The biggest tip is the point of rotation: Rotate once your upper body is PARALLEL with the bench angle - DON'T COME ALL THE WAY UP

- Rotate 90 degrees right then 90 degrees left - pick a point either side of you and look at that point every time you rotate that direction to ensure complete rotation

- Extend your arms all the way back behind your head while engaging your core the entire time

- As with all other exercises practice with no weight until you get the movement correct then upgrade to weight

- I use the 8kg medicine ball and aim for 10 reps total

- By far my favourite Ab exercise! 

- As mentioned in the video, your bum position determines exercise difficulty

- If your bum is entirely off the end of the bench then the exercise is most difficult as your point of rotation is further away from your feet 

- If your bum is half way off (tail bone approx. at the edge of bench) this is medium difficulty

- If your bum is entirely on the bench this is the easiest difficulty

- Legs straight on the downward leg, almost touch the floor with your heels but don't bounce/push off

- Straight legs as you pull back up then once you reach your hip area bend your knees, pull in with your upper abs and thrust your legs your legs vertically away from you

- Hold at the top, elevating your bum off the bench as in the video 

- Go for 8 reps, however please understand these are hard (especially for beginners) so get as many reps in as you can! -
