- [WARM UP]

- My personal preference is the seated part of the bench slightly inclined and the back of the bench not directly upright but also slightly inclined

- This makes my movements feel a lot less restricted and puts less direct pressure on my joints

- I'm also pushing forward fairly strongly with both legs for maximum stability

- Slow, controlled movements, not letting the dumbbells come below my shoulder line

- I currently rep 30kg for 6 reps, 4 sets. Working on getting up to 10 reps before increasing weight!

- Straight into Arnold presses - they're amazing for all 3 of your shoulder heads (front, rear and lateral)

- Start with weights in front of your chest, rotated as I have in the video. Swing your arms around so they're next to your head then push up as you would a normal shoulder press

- It's quite a complex movement so watch the video first - it's a much better explanation than my description haha!!

- Key point is to really focus on form in your early stages so you get it down pat before increasing the weight

- Smooth controlled transitional movement from your standard shoulder press down into the rotational component

- I rep 16kg dumbbells for these, 8-10 reps

- Feet shoulder width apart and strong core - this strong foundation will set you up for a great set

- Hands placed just outside shoulder width apart - one thumb length away from the shiny part of the bar

- One rep in front of head, one rep behind head

- Start with no weight on the bar and get your form perfect before proceeding

- Touching just above the back of your neck on the behind-the-head movement

- I do these with 7.5kg on either side of the bar but it's taken me a long time to get up to this weight

Shoulder machine (drop-set):

- Fairly self explanatory - the main reason for using the machine is to be able to drop set at the end

- Same rules as before apply for drop sets - start at your working weight for 8 reps, move up 2 pegs and do 10 reps, move up another 2 and do 12 etc

- I rep ~45kg for my working weight then drop set from there!

- My favourite superset of shoulder day

- Lateral raises: Pull up with your elbows, lock your arm angle as shown in the tutorial video, bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height but don't overextend

- Strong legs as a foundation for a great exercise

- Front raises: Slow and controlled movement, arms slightly angled, bring plate to at least head height if not higher - don't sway your movements, pull with your front delts

- I rep 12kg for lateral raises and typically do front raises with a 20kg plate
