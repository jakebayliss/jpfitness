- [WARM UP]

- Warm-up set with body weight then straight into it

- Don't over-stride - keep stride length reasonable so you're not over extending, losing balance

- Shoulders back, vertical torso - core engaged, knee directly over ankle with majority of your weight in your front foot

- Superset with bodyweight squats (mainly so I can still incorporate squats and reap some of their benefits)

- I like to do ~14kg each arm, 10 reps each leg

- Feet shoulder width apart, bend your hips and knees simultaneously

- Lean back into the squat - hinging at the hips, keep your back neutral and core engaged

- I do bodyweight sets here as my lower back is injured!

Hamstring machine:

- Great exercise for adding inches to your legs, stabilising and supporting your back

- Slow and controlled movements are required

- If your gym has a flat hamstring machine then use it! I only use this seated version as mine doesn't have one

- I am currently repping around 40kg for 10 reps

Leg Extensions:

- If you have a manual machine (as in the video) for these you're winning at life, the one at my gym is life changing - makes me want to do 10 sets

- Slow and controlled movements

- Powerful positive motion, slow negatives

- Key is bench positioning - you need to have your back rest set so that your knees are hinging around the edge of the seat - as in the video

- I do 3, 20kg plates, 10 reps for 4 sets

Leg Press Superset Calf Raises:

- Back rest position is once again key - I like to have it configured so, when resting on the press, my legs are slightly bent (as in the video)

- This enables me to comfortably push off the safety holders and gives a nice smooth full range of motion during the set

- Don't go too heavy if it's your first time doing leg press - start off with no weight to get used to the machine and the safety mechanism then start to stack up weight as you see fit!

- If you're properly positioned (as above) then once you lock the machine back in its starting position you can begin calf raises without any adjustments

- This is great because you don't need to disengage the safety to do calf raises now!

- I typically leg press x3 20kg plates either side and calf raise the same!

Leg extension drop-set to finish:

- Similarly to the above leg extensions you want to position the machine so your knees are pivoting nicely off the bench

- Machine required for these as it's much faster - x2 normal sets then x1 drop set: Start at your working weight for 6 reps, drop 2 pegs for 8 reps, 2 more pegs for 10 reps and finally 2 more pegs til failure

- I'm currently doing 65kg to start with then dropping in increments of 8kg each time I drop set
