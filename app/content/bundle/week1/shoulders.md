Shoulder day is hereeeee - because it's one of my favourite days I typically throw it in after legs as motivation to get through leg day hahah. As with all other days start by watching and listening to the tutorial videos carefully. I explain everything I'm thinking/doing during the actual set which I find helps tremendously.

Shoulders have probably been my weakest (looks & strength wise) muscle group for my whole gym career, particularly at the start. Due to this, I would hit them x2 a week in the early stages of my gym career to catch them up with the rest of my body. During this process they quickly became one of my favourite body parts to train. This paid off tremendously when I picked up surfing as shoulder strength (and back) are key to paddling technique! They're also one of the main features visible in t-shirts so they're key to having a great physique.

- 

- My personal preference is the seated part of the bench slightly inclined and the back of the bench not directly upright but also slightly inclined

- This makes my movements feel a lot less restricted and puts less direct pressure on my joints

- I'm also pushing forward fairly strongly with both legs for maximum stability

- Slow, controlled movements, not letting the dumbbells come below my shoulder line

- I currently rep 30kg for 6 reps, 4 sets. Working on getting up to 10 reps before increasing weight!

- Straight into Arnold presses - they're amazing for all 3 of your shoulder heads (front, rear and lateral)

- Start with weights in front of your chest, rotated as I have in the video. Swing your arms around so they're next to your head then push up as you would a normal shoulder press

- It's quite a complex movement so watch the video first - it's a much better explanation than my description haha!!

- Key point is to really focus on form in your early stages so you get it down pat before increasing the weight

- Smooth controlled transitional movement from your standard shoulder press down into the rotational component

- I rep 16kg dumbbells for these, 8-10 reps

- My favourite superset of shoulder day

- Lateral raises: Pull up with your elbows, lock your arm angle as shown in the tutorial video, bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height but don't overextend

- Strong legs as a foundation for a great exercise

- Front raises: Slow and controlled movement, arms slightly angled, bring plate to at least head height if not higher - don't sway your movements, pull with your front delts

- I rep 12kg for lateral raises and typically do front raises with a 20kg plate

- Feet shoulder width apart and strong core - this strong foundation will set you up for a great set

- Hands placed just outside shoulder width apart - one thumb length away from the shiny part of the bar

- One rep in front of head, one rep behind head

- Start with no weight on the bar and get your form perfect before proceeding

- Touching just above the back of your neck on the behind-the-head movement

- I do these with 7.5kg on either side of the bar but it's taken me a long time to get up to this weight

<summary><b>Shoulder Machine (DropSet)</b></summary>

- Fairly self explanatory - the main reason for using the machine is to be able to drop set at the end

- Same rules as before apply for drop sets - start at your working weight for 8 reps, move up 2 pegs and do 10 reps, move up another 2 and do 12 etc

- I rep ~45kg for my working weight then drop set from there!
