<summary><b>Notes</b></summary>

The dreaded leg day has come round, and guess what, we're doing a 15 minute ab burner session at the end! Woooo!!!!

As with Day 1, start by watching and listening to the tutorial videos carefully. I explain everything I'm thinking/doing during the actual set which I find helps tremendously.

For many years after my lower back injury (which happened while squatting) my legs seriously lacked size, and I lacked motivation to train them. Firstly, I was scared my back would give way again, and I was reluctant to train them without including squats. However, they're now a part of my weekly routine and I'm learning to love training them once more. For those of you that would like to squat during my program I've included a section to next week (replacing your lunges next week with squats).

- Warm-up set with body weight then straight into it

- Don't over-stride - keep stride length reasonable so you're not over extending, losing balance

- Shoulders back, vertical torso - core engaged, knee directly over ankle with majority of your weight in your front foot

- Superset with bodyweight squats (mainly so I can still incorporate squats and reap some of their benefits)

- I like to do ~14kg each arm, 10 reps each leg

- Feet shoulder width apart, bend your hips and knees simultaneously

- Lean back into the squat - hinging at the hips, keep your back neutral and core engaged

- I do bodyweight sets here as my lower back is injured!

<summary><b>Leg Extensions</b></summary>

- If you have a manual machine (as in the video) for these you're winning at life, the one at my gym is life changing - makes me want to do 10 sets

- Slow and controlled movements

- Powerful positive motion, slow negatives

- Key is bench positioning - you need to have your back rest set so that your knees are hinging around the edge of the seat - as in the video

- I do 3, 20kg plates, 10 reps for 4 sets

<summary><b>Leg Press SS Calf Raises</b></summary>

- Back rest position is once again key - I like to have it configured so, when resting on the press, my legs are slightly bent (as in the video)

- This enables me to comfortably push off the safety holders and gives a nice smooth full range of motion during the set

- Don't go too heavy if it's your first time doing leg press - start off with no weight to get used to the machine and the safety mechanism then start to stack up weight as you see fit!

- If you're properly positioned (as above) then once you lock the machine back in its starting position you can begin calf raises without any adjustments

- This is great because you don't need to disengage the safety to do calf raises now!

- I typically leg press x3 20kg plates either side and calf raise the same!

<summary><b>Hamstring Machine</b></summary>

</figure>

- Great exercise for adding inches to your legs, stabilising and supporting your back

- Slow and controlled movements are required

- If your gym has a flat hamstring machine then use it! I only use this seated version as mine doesn't have one

- I am currently repping around 40kg for 10 reps

<summary><b>Leg Extension Machine</b></summary>

  </video>
</figure>

- Similarly to the above leg extensions you want to position the machine so your knees are pivoting nicely off the bench

- Machine required for these as it's much faster - x2 normal sets then x1 drop set: Start at your working weight for 6 reps, drop 2 pegs for 8 reps, 2 more pegs for 10 reps and finally 2 more pegs til failure

- I'm currently doing 65kg to start with then dropping in increments of 8kg each time I drop set

<summary><b>Notes for Abs</b></summary>

Today's ab session is a continuous circuit - you do the first exercise, then the next, then the next all the way up until the last and that counts as 1 set. Repeat 4 times and that's your abs routine conquered for the day!

<summary><b>Bicycle Kicks</b></summary>

  </video>
</figure>

- Start lying flat on the ground, raise both legs off the ground and engage your core so your head is also off the ground, supported by your hands behind your head

- Bring one knee in to your chest and simultaneously bring your opposite elbow in to touch that knee (as in the video)

- Once you have the movement locked in speed it up - I like to do my bicycles at a rapid pace for a great burn 

- As explained in the video a great tip is to pick an object at 90 degrees either side of you so youâ€™re looking at it, and thus rotating the correct amount, every rep

- Aiming for a minimum of 20 reps, 10 elbow taps on each side

<summary><b>Oblique Planks</b></summary>

  </video>
</figure>

- Start in a plank position - basically a push up but on your elbows 

- Lock your feet together and in place

- Rotate your hips to one side of your body and let that hip touch the floor

- Rotate back the other way and touch your other hip

- Repeat 20 times, 10 hip-taps on each side

- Hold your back strong throughout and lean/rotate with your oblique muscles

<summary><b>Side-plank Thrusts</b></summary>

  </video>
</figure>

- Begin lying on your side, supporting your bodyweight with your elbow

- Ensure your back is straight and your body forms a straight line from your head to the toes

- Engage your core before you start the movement - then thrust upward by lifting your hips

- Once at the top, your body should form a straight line down to your toes

- Avoid over-arching your back by keeping your core engaged throughout 

- I aim for 16 reps on each side, 32 total for the set

</figure>

- These are a killer finisher to our rotation

- Lie flat with your arms and legs extended all the way

- Raise one leg vertical and crunch up to meet it as I do in the video, engaging your core the entire time

- Tap that leg with your opposite arm and then lower back down 

- Repeat with the opposite leg/arm 

- I aim for 10 taps each arm, 20 taps total
