<summary><b>Notes</b></summary>

- Warming up is one of the most important parts of working out. It prevents injury by increasing your muscle temperature, which makes them more flexible hence less prone to injury. This ensures you will be able to work out for many years to come.

- It increases your heart rate, which increases blood flow thus delivering more oxygen and nutrients to your muscles - making them ready for exercise!

- It also increases the production of synovial fluid which lubricates your joints. This reduces friction and allows smoother movements

- A good warm-up will improve muscle contractility, allowing you to generate more force and power during your workout, leading to better workout performance and overall gains

- You can see I include warming up your rotator cuffs in every upper-body day. This is because, in my mind, they're the most important bodypart to warm-up to ensure shoulder injuries are prevented

- Your rotator cuff is a group of muslces and tendons in your shoulders that allow your shoulders to rotate and is fundamental for nearly all upper body exercises - healthy shoulders are so important for a long and prosperous gym career as they're used in nearly every single upper-body exercise

- ENSURE YOU'RE WARMING UP BEFORE EVERY SINGLE WORKOUT and please follow the tutorial videos provided!
