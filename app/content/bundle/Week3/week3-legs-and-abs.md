- 

- Warm-up set with body weight then straight into it

- Don't over-stride - keep stride length reasonable so you're not over extending, losing balance

- Shoulders back, vertical torso - core engaged, knee directly over ankle with majority of your weight in your front foot

- Superset with bodyweight squats (mainly so I can still incorporate squats and reap some of their benefits)

- I like to do ~14kg each arm, 10 reps each leg

- Feet shoulder width apart, bend your hips and knees simultaneously

- Lean back into the squat - hinging at the hips, keep your back neutral and core engaged

- I do bodyweight sets here as my lower back is injured!

<summary><b>Leg Press SS Calf Raises</b></summary

- Back rest position is once again key - I like to have it configured so, when resting on the press, my legs are slightly bent (as in the video)

- This enables me to comfortably push off the safety holders and gives a nice smooth full range of motion during the set

- Don't go too heavy if it's your first time doing leg press - start off with no weight to get used to the machine and the safety mechanism then start to stack up weight as you see fit!

- If you're properly positioned (as above) then once you lock the machine back in its starting position you can begin calf raises without any adjustments

- This is great because you don't need to disengage the safety to do calf raises now!

- I typically leg press x3 20kg plates either side and calf raise the same!

- If you have a manual machine (as in the video) for these you're winning at life, the one at my gym is life changing - makes me want to do 10 sets

- Slow and controlled movements

- Powerful positive motion, slow negatives

- Key is bench positioning - you need to have your back rest set so that your knees are hinging around the edge of the seat - as in the video

- I do 3, 20kg plates, 10 reps for 4 sets

- Great exercise for adding inches to your legs, stabilising and supporting your back

- Slow and controlled movements are required

- If your gym has a flat hamstring machine then use it! I only use this seated version as mine doesn't have one

- I am currently repping around 40kg for 10 reps

</figure>

- Similarly to the above leg extensions you want to position the machine so your knees are pivoting nicely off the bench

- Machine required for these as it's much faster - x2 normal sets then x1 drop set: Start at your working weight for 6 reps, drop 2 pegs for 8 reps, 2 more pegs for 10 reps and finally 2 more pegs til failure

- I'm currently doing 65kg to start with then dropping in increments of 8kg each time I drop set

</figure>

- Start lying in a plank position, then rest one elbow on the ground to support you and balance with your other hand on the floor

- Extend one leg straight out behind you, point your toes then bring your leg all the way up so your knee almost touches your elbow

- Try and maintain a straight back and don't twist your body, keeping your core engaged and pulling your leg up with your obliques

- 12 reps on one side then swap arms and do another 12 reps on the other side

  </video>
</figure>

- Starting position is lying on your side with legs extended, supporting yourself with one arm resting on the ground and the other arm is behind your head 

- Point your toes and simultaneously lift your head & legs off the floor, bringing your head towards your hips

- Don't pull yourself up with the hand on your head and don't push up with the hand that's on the floor

- Keep your core engaged the entire time and pull with your oblique muscles

- 12 reps on each side, swap sides and do 12 on the other!

- I like to do crunches with feet shoulder width apart and hands crossed on my chest

- You can do them with hands behind your head but cheat & pull yourself up like this! 

- Make sure you're pulling up with your abs!! 

- You guys know bicycle form by now, pick a point on either side of you at 90 degrees and make sure you look at it each rep to ensure complete torso rotation!

- 20 reps of crunches, 20 bicycles

</figure>

- These are usually done lying flat on the floor, and if you'd like to mainly hit lower abs then feel free to do lying scissor kicks 

- I've opted to do them at a slight incline so it engages my whole core while still hitting lower abs

- Point your feet and try keep your legs as straight as possible, raising them as high as you can each rep and don't let your feet hit the floor on the way down

- 20 reps total

</figure>

- Toe-tap form is determined by how close/far apart your feet are - the closer they are together the harder the exercise will be, as you core will have to rotate further to touch each foot

- Perform them at a slight incline so your abs are engaged the whole time 

- You guys are also mountain climbers experts now so smash these out as you've been doing during Day 2! 

- 20 toe-taps, 20 climbers!
