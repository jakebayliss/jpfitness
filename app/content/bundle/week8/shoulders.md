- 

- Starting with smith machine press today, I want 5 working sets (so excluding warm-up) with 6 reps max - GO HEAVY!

- Bench positioning is key - have it in the center of the bar, completely upright with enough room so the bar touches your upper chest on the way down

- Once in position add weights as you see fit

- Start with hands thumb-width away from the shiny section of the bar as you can see I have in the video

- Normal shoulder press movement, stopping when the bar is at shoulder height (slightly above chest as in video)

- I usually do 10-15kg either side, so today I'm doing 20kg!

- My favourite superset of shoulder day

- Lateral raises: Pull up with your elbows, lock your arm angle as shown in the tutorial video, bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height but don't overextend

- Strong legs as a foundation for a great exercise

- Front raises: Slow and controlled movement, arms slightly angled, bring plate to at least head height if not higher - don't sway your movements, pull with your front delts

- I rep 12kg for lateral raises and typically do front raises with a 20kg plate

- Amazing rear-delt exercise

- Position the cable on or very near the maximum height

- Use one of the lower weights on your opening set to ensure your form is correct

- Grip the rope at its ends and take one large step backwards with feet shoulder width apart

- Start with arms extended straight then pull in towards your head, squeezing when your hands are either side of your head

- Repeat slowly, aiming for 10-12 reps, shoulders locked in place so you're not pulling with your back

- [WEIGHT REQUIRED]

- Set the cable machine at the lowest position

- Grab a handle attachment piece and latch it on

- Start on an extremely low weight so you perfect your form first

- Pull upwards with your shoulder - don't let your arm rotate and sneakily use your tri's, back or any other muscle for the raise

- Hold at the top slightly then slowly lower back down to resting position, repeat for sets of 8-12!

- I rep ~peg 3 on the cable machine, so approximately 10kg at my gym

- Finish with the classic shoulder press - remember go heavy - I want you leaving the gym covered in sweat! 

- My personal preference is the seated part of the bench slightly inclined and the back of the bench not directly upright but also slightly inclined

- This makes my movements feel a lot less restricted and puts less direct pressure on my joints

- I'm also pushing forward fairly strongly with both legs for maximum stability

- Slow, controlled movements, not letting the dumbbells come below my shoulder line

- I currently rep 30kg for 6 reps, 4 sets so today will be doing 32kg for 4 sets! It'll be fkn hard but so worth it
