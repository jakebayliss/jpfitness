- Definitely start these on an assisted machine.

- Start with your elbows locked and arms straight, then slowly lower yourself to 90 degrees (the forearm/upper arm angle I reach in the vid) then power back up to vertical

- Dips are amazing for both chest and triceps so you could include in your chest day too

- Don't go too far down or you'll hurt your shoulder, 90 degree bend like in the video is good

- If you can't dip your bodyweight then use the assisted machine that most gyms provide

- I do 8-12 reps of body weight dips

- Lock your elbows into your obliques for best form

- Slow reps down, maximise control

- For maximum burn on any curls don't let your arms go completely vertical - this keeps your bicep engaged for the duration of your set

- Minimise body-rocking while curling for complete bicep engagement

- Start light and work your way up as form/strength improves

- Currently on 16kg for 8 reps each arm

- Lock elbows for the duration of your set

- Don't let your hands come too far above elbow height to ensure triceps are constantly engaged

- Hold bar at the edge and push outwards at the bottom while you SQUEEZE

- Ensure you're squeezing every rep - burn those triceps baby

- Lock elbows as per!!

 -Try minimise upper-body rocking, I know it's hard but try!

 -Arms are spaced extremely close to one another, inside elbow-width apart with pinky fingers almost touching

- Close grip curls are amazing for increasing the size of the peak of your bicep - which is what we're chasing baby!

- As above, they're amazing to drop-set!

- Start with your arms fully relaxed, then curl up to half way up your arm or a 90 degree arm-forearm angle - rep 7 times like this, then 7 in the upper half and 7 complete curls

- Form is incredibly important to ensure your bi's are constantly engaged

- Always go to failure on close grip part

- Short rest between sets, get that blood flowing

- Depending on your bicep/tricep strength I would recommend a weight ~1/3 your bodyweight

- Lock your elbows when doing your overheads, it's essential for tricep engagement

- I rep 25kg, 21 reps bicep curls, 8-10 reps overhead extensions and failure for close grip bench

- Amazing exercise for building that outer head and increasing arm thickness

- Tip is to stand right in the centre of the cable and extend outwards at an angle

- This means you'll already naturally be finishing each rep with your arm angled outwards, further targeting your lateral (outer) head

 -As with all tricep exercises SQUEEZE at the bottom

- Try perform these isolated curls on a bench right near your cable extensions

- Lock your elbow firmly into your leg and curl normally

- Start low weight until you get the form correct then work your way up

- These are a targeted exercise so don't over-do yourself weight wise

- Squeeze at the top and slow release back down

- I typically rep 8-10kg and do 4 sets of the Superset

- Close grip doesn't necessarily mean pinky fingers touching like it does for other exercises, go shoulder width apart

- I am well aware these are also targeting your upper-back and I still chose to do them because there's no such thing as doing too many pull-ups!

- Use an assisted machine if you can't do them on their own - this is totally normal they're an extremely hard exercise!

- Go for failure every set, it doesnâ€™t matter if this is 3, 6 or 20 reps - burn yourself out we're at the end of an amazing arms day here

- Weight - N/A, each set til FAILURE BABY

</figure>

- Position yourself so the medicine ball is approximately under your calves

- Extend legs all the way out, don't let your feet touch the floor

- Sync your body - as your legs extend lean backwards to really engage your abs 

- Quick reps, high intensity

- Aim for 10 per side, so 20 total taps

- Controlled movements - don't go too heavy as you'll start using every part of your body other than your abs to try get it completed 

- Extend those arms as you come down, don't let the ball touch the floor

- Thrust upwards with your abs, hold at the top slightly and repeat

- I like to do these with an 8kg medicine ball, 12 reps minimum

- The biggest take home message is to keep your back as I keep mine in the video

- Don't lean forward or backwards, lean perfectly straight (in the lateral direction) as I do in the second half of the video

- Pull with your obiques, having one hand on the opposite side of your body to the weight - I find - really helps me mentally picture lifting using purely my obliques

- Hold at the top, slowly back down

- I do 16 reps minimum (each side) using a 20kg plate

- The biggest tip is the point of rotation: Rotate once your upper body is PARALLEL with the bench angle - DON'T COME ALL THE WAY UP

- Rotate 90 degrees right then 90 degrees left - pick a point either side of you and look at that point every time you rotate that direction to ensure complete rotation

- Extend your arms all the way back behind your head while engaging your core the entire time

- As with all other exercises practice with no weight until you get the movement correct then upgrade to weight

- I use the 8kg medicine ball and aim for 10 reps total

- By far my favourite Ab exercise! 

- As mentioned in the video, your bum position determines exercise difficulty

- If your bum is entirely off the end of the bench then the exercise is most difficult as your point of rotation is further away from your feet 

- If your bum is half way off (tail bone approx. at the edge of bench) this is medium difficulty

- If your bum is entirely on the bench this is the easiest difficulty

- Legs straight on the downward leg, almost touch the floor with your heels but don't bounce/push off

- Straight legs as you pull back up then once you reach your hip area bend your knees, pull in with your upper abs and thrust your legs your legs vertically away from you

- Hold at the top, elevating your bum off the bench as in the video 

- Go for 8 reps, however please understand these are hard (especially for beginners) so get as many reps in as you can! -

- Start lying in a plank position, then rest one elbow on the ground to support you and balance with your other hand on the floor

- Extend one leg straight out behind you, point your toes then bring your leg all the way up so your knee almost touches your elbow

- Try and maintain a straight back and don't twist your body, keeping your core engaged and pulling your leg up with your obliques

- 12 reps on one side then swap arms and do another 12 reps on the other side

- Starting position is lying on your side with legs extended, supporting yourself with one arm resting on the ground and the other arm is behind your head 

- Point your toes and simultaneously lift your head & legs off the floor, bringing your head towards your hips

- Don't pull yourself up with the hand on your head and don't push up with the hand that's on the floor

- Keep your core engaged the entire time and pull with your oblique muscles

- 12 reps on each side, swap sides and do 12 on the other!

- I like to do crunches with feet shoulder width apart and hands crossed on my chest

- You can do them with hands behind your head but cheat & pull yourself up like this! 

- Make sure you're pulling up with your abs!! 

- You guys know bicycle form by now, pick a point on either side of you at 90 degrees and make sure you look at it each rep to ensure complete torso rotation!

- 20 reps of crunches, 20 bicycles

- These are usually done lying flat on the floor, and if you'd like to mainly hit lower abs then feel free to do lying scissor kicks 

- I've opted to do them at a slight incline so it engages my whole core while still hitting lower abs

- Point your feet and try keep your legs as straight as possible, raising them as high as you can each rep and don't let your feet hit the floor on the way down

- 20 reps total

</figure>

- Toe-tap form is determined by how close/far apart your feet are - the closer they are together the harder the exercise will be, as you core will have to rotate further to touch each foot

- Perform them at a slight incline so your abs are engaged the whole time 

- You guys are also mountain climbers experts now so smash these out as you've been doing during Day 2! 

- 20 toe-taps, 20 climbers!
