- Close grip doesn't necessarily mean pinky fingers touching like it does for other exercises, go shoulder width apart

- I am well aware these are also targeting your upper-back and I still chose to do them because there's no such thing as doing too many pull-ups!

- Use an assisted machine if you can't do them on their own - this is totally normal they're an extremely hard exercise!

- Go for failure every set, it doesn’t matter if this is 3, 6 or 20 reps - burn yourself out we're at the end of an amazing arms day here

- Weight - N/A, each set til FAILURE BABY

- Lock elbows for the duration of your set

- Don't let your hands come too far above elbow height to ensure triceps are constantly engaged

- Hold bar at the edge and push outwards at the bottom while you SQUEEZE

- Ensure you're squeezing every rep - burn those triceps baby

- Lock elbows as per!!

 -Try minimise upper-body rocking, I know it's hard but try!

 -Arms are spaced extremely close to one another, inside elbow-width apart with pinky fingers almost touching

- Close grip curls are amazing for increasing the size of the peak of your bicep - which is what we're chasing baby!

- As above, they're amazing to drop-set!

- Amazing exercise for building that outer head and increasing arm thickness

- Tip is to stand right in the centre of the cable and extend outwards at an angle

- This means you'll already naturally be finishing each rep with your arm angled outwards, further targeting your lateral (outer) head

 -As with all tricep exercises SQUEEZE at the bottom

- Try perform these isolated curls on a bench right near your cable extensions

- Lock your elbow firmly into your leg and curl normally

- Start low weight until you get the form correct then work your way up

- These are a targeted exercise so don't over-do yourself weight wise

- Squeeze at the top and slow release back down

- I typically rep 8-10kg and do 4 sets of the Superset

- Definitely start these on an assisted machine.

- Start with your elbows locked and arms straight, then slowly lower yourself to 90 degrees (the forearm/upper arm angle I reach in the vid) then power back up to vertical

- Dips are amazing for both chest and triceps so you could include in your chest day too

- Don't go too far down or you'll hurt your shoulder, 90 degree bend like in the video is good

- If you can't dip your bodyweight then use the assisted machine that most gyms provide

- I do 8-12 reps of body weight dips

- Lock your elbows into your obliques for best form

- Slow reps down, maximise control

- For maximum burn on any curls don't let your arms go completely vertical - this keeps your bicep engaged for the duration of your set

- Minimise body-rocking while curling for complete bicep engagement

- Start light and work your way up as form/strength improves

- Currently on 16kg for 8 reps each arm

- Start with your arms fully relaxed, then curl up to half way up your arm or a 90 degree arm-forearm angle - rep 7 times like this, then 7 in the upper half and 7 complete curls

- Form is incredibly important to ensure your bi's are constantly engaged

- Always go to failure on close grip part

- Short rest between sets, get that blood flowing

- Depending on your bicep/tricep strength I would recommend a weight ~1/3 your bodyweight

- Lock your elbows when doing your overheads, it's essential for tricep engagement

- I rep 25kg, 21 reps bicep curls, 8-10 reps overhead extensions and failure for close grip bench

- Start lying flat on the ground, raise both legs off the ground and engage your core so your head is also off the ground, supported by your hands behind your head

- Bring one knee in to your chest and simultaneously bring your opposite elbow in to touch that knee (as in the video)

- Once you have the movement locked in speed it up - I like to do my bicycles at a rapid pace for a great burn 

- As explained in the video a great tip is to pick an object at 90 degrees either side of you so you’re looking at it, and thus rotating the correct amount, every rep

- Aiming for a minimum of 20 reps, 10 elbow taps on each side

</figure>

- Start in a plank position - basically a push up but on your elbows 

- Lock your feet together and in place

- Rotate your hips to one side of your body and let that hip touch the floor

- Rotate back the other way and touch your other hip

- Repeat 20 times, 10 hip-taps on each side

- Hold your back strong throughout and lean/rotate with your oblique muscles

  </video>
</figure>

- Begin lying on your side, supporting your bodyweight with your elbow

- Ensure your back is straight and your body forms a straight line from your head to the toes

- Engage your core before you start the movement - then thrust upward by lifting your hips

- Once at the top, your body should form a straight line down to your toes

- Avoid over-arching your back by keeping your core engaged throughout 

- I aim for 16 reps on each side, 32 total for the set

- These are a killer finisher to our rotation

- Lie flat with your arms and legs extended all the way

- Raise one leg vertical and crunch up to meet it as I do in the video, engaging your core the entire time

- Tap that leg with your opposite arm and then lower back down 

- Repeat with the opposite leg/arm 

- I aim for 10 taps each arm, 20 taps total
