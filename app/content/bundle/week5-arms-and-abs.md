- Start with your arms fully relaxed, then curl up to half way up your arm or a 90 degree arm-forearm angle - rep 7 times like this, then 7 in the upper half and 7 complete curls

- Form is incredibly important to ensure your bi's are constantly engaged

- Always go to failure on close grip part

- Short rest between sets, get that blood flowing

- Depending on your bicep/tricep strength I would recommend a weight ~1/3 your bodyweight

- Lock your elbows when doing your overheads, it's essential for tricep engagement

- I rep 25kg, 21 reps bicep curls, 8-10 reps overhead extensions and failure for close grip bench

- Start with arms vertical, slowly curl upwards until you're at the natural 'top' of the rep as in video, slow release back down

- Also great to pair with a chest exercise if you want a sneaky arm pump on chest day

- Slow and controlled is key

- Do less weight than you would normally curl, these are targeted and harder

- Lock your elbows into the bench to establish a good pivot point for your arm

- Roll shoulders back to isolate those biceps

- Keep your upper arm as vertical as you can

- I use 10-12kg dumbbells for 12 reps

- Killer superset, lock those fkn elbows!!

- Really pull OUTWARDS at the bottom of every rep to engage those tri's

- Don't let your arms come all the way up, stop roughly where I stop in the video

- These are both unreal to dropset if you're feeling frisky!

- Weight for these is highly dependant on what kind of cable machine you use. Some of them I'm ~20kg for 8 reps, others I do around 40kg

- Lock elbows as per!!

- Try minimise upper-body rocking, I know it's hard but try!

- Arms are spaced extremely close to one another, inside elbow-width apart with pinky fingers almost touching

- Close grip curls are amazing for increasing the size of the peak of your bicep - which is what we're chasing baby!

- As above, they're amazing to dropset!

<summary><b>Preacher Curls SS Long Negatives</b></summary

- Slooooow negatives

- Good tip is to set up the chair height perfectly for you. The height that feels best for me is demonstrated in the video and it's fairly low as I like my whole upper body locked in place

- If you don't have a gym partner then do 8 exactly as I do in the video - 8 reps of normal preacher curls, 4-8 reps of slow, strong negatives

- Weight is not so important here - more important is form and how slowly you can lower the bar each time

- If you can get a friend/gym partner to resist (push down) while you try hold the negatives as long as possible this will have you both looking and feeling like superman/superwoman

- I currently do 12.5kg on either side of the bar for 8 reps then 4-6 ultra long negatives to finish each set

- Definitely start these on an assisted machine.

- Start with your elbows locked and arms straight, then slowly lower yourself to 90 degrees (the forearm/upper arm angle I reach in the vid) then power back up to vertical

- Dips are amazing for both chest and triceps so you could include in your chest day too

- Don't go too far down or you'll hurt your shoulder, 90 degree bend like in the video is good

- If you can't dip your bodyweight then use the assisted machine that most gyms provide

- I do 8-12 reps of body weight dips

- Lock your elbows into your obliques for best form

- Slow reps down, maximise control

- For maximum burn on any curls don't let your arms go completely vertical - this keeps your bicep engaged for the duration of your set

- Minimise body-rocking while curling for complete bicep engagement

- Start light and work your way up as form/strength improves

- Currently on 16kg for 8 reps each arm

- Start lying in a plank position, then rest one elbow on the ground to support you and balance with your other hand on the floor

- Extend one leg straight out behind you, point your toes then bring your leg all the way up so your knee almost touches your elbow

- Try and maintain a straight back and don't twist your body, keeping your core engaged and pulling your leg up with your obliques

- 12 reps on one side then swap arms and do another 12 reps on the other side

</figure>

- Starting position is lying on your side with legs extended, supporting yourself with one arm resting on the ground and the other arm is behind your head 

- Point your toes and simultaneously lift your head & legs off the floor, bringing your head towards your hips

- Don't pull yourself up with the hand on your head and don't push up with the hand that's on the floor

- Keep your core engaged the entire time and pull with your oblique muscles

- 12 reps on each side, swap sides and do 12 on the other!

- I like to do crunches with feet shoulder width apart and hands crossed on my chest

- You can do them with hands behind your head but cheat & pull yourself up like this! 

- Make sure you're pulling up with your abs!! 

- You guys know bicycle form by now, pick a point on either side of you at 90 degrees and make sure you look at it each rep to ensure complete torso rotation!

- 20 reps of crunches, 20 bicycles

- These are usually done lying flat on the floor, and if you'd like to mainly hit lower abs then feel free to do lying scissor kicks 

- I've opted to do them at a slight incline so it engages my whole core while still hitting lower abs

- Point your feet and try keep your legs as straight as possible, raising them as high as you can each rep and don't let your feet hit the floor on the way down

- 20 reps total

  </video>
</figure>

- Toe-tap form is determined by how close/far apart your feet are - the closer they are together the harder the exercise will be, as you core will have to rotate further to touch each foot

- Perform them at a slight incline so your abs are engaged the whole time 

- You guys are also mountain climbers experts now so smash these out as you've been doing during Day 2! 

- 20 toe-taps, 20 climbers!
